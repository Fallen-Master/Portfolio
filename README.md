# Porfolio
    
## Description
Welcome to my React-based portfolio! This isn't just any portfolio; it's a single-page application that really puts my React skills on display. But it's more than a showcase of projects it's a story of my dedication and the growth I experienced during the KU Boot Camp. I've used Bulma-React for styling, which I think adds a nice touch. This whole portfolio is a practical demonstration of what I've learned and, perfectly capturing my journey in the of web development.
